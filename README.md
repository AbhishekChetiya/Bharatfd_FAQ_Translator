Backend Developer Project - FAQs Management with Multi-language Support
Objective
This project aims to design a backend system for managing FAQs with multi-language support. The main features include:

Integration of a WYSIWYG editor (CKEditor).
Multi-language translations for FAQs.
API for CRUD operations with caching and performance optimizations.
Unit tests to ensure correctness.
Steps to Complete the Project

1. Model Design
The first step was to create the FAQ model. Here's how I structured the model:

Fields:
question: A TextField to store the FAQ question.
answer: A CKEditor5Field to allow users to store rich-text answers.
language: A CharField to handle different languages (English, Hindi, Bengali, etc.).
I also added a method for string representation (__str__), which shows the FAQ in a user-friendly format:
def __str__(self):
    return f"FAQ: {self.question} ({self.language})"
The model ensures that the combination of question and language is unique using the unique_together constraint.

2. WYSIWYG Editor Integration
I integrated the CKEditor5 WYSIWYG editor to allow rich-text formatting for FAQ answers. To achieve this:

I installed the django-ckeditor-5 package and configured it in the settings.
Used the CKEditor5Field to enable rich-text support in the FAQ model.
This integration allows users to format their answers easily with text styling, links, images, etc.

3. Multi-language Editor
To support multi-language content:

I added separate fields for different languages (like question_hi, question_bn, etc.) for each FAQ.
The system uses Google Translate API to automatically translate content during FAQ creation (using the googletrans library).
The translated content is stored in the database and the fallback mechanism ensures English is used if no translation is available.
4. Frontend
Though the primary focus is backend development, I created a basic frontend to interact with the API. Here's what I did:

Used HTML and JavaScript to create simple forms for submitting FAQs in Django.
A dropdown was added for users to select the language when submitting a new FAQ.

5. Google Translation
For multi-language support, I integrated Google Translate API using the googletrans library. This is how the translation works:

When a new FAQ is created, the question and answer fields are automatically translated into multiple languages (if translations are available).
The translated answers are saved to the database and can be fetched using the corresponding language.

6. Redis for Caching
To optimize the performance of the translation feature, I implemented a caching mechanism using Redis.

Steps for setting up Redis caching:

Installed the Redis server and the django-redis package.
Configured Django to use Redis as a cache backend in the settings.py file:
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'django_redis.cache.RedisCache',
        'LOCATION': 'redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'CLIENT_CLASS': 'django_redis.client.DefaultClient',
        }
    }
}
Used Redis to store translated FAQ answers, reducing the number of API calls for translation and improving performance.

7. API Development
I created a REST API to handle CRUD operations for FAQs.
Endpoints include:
Create FAQ: POST /api/faqs/
Get FAQ by Language: GET /api/faqs/?lang=<language_code>
The API supports the lang query parameter to select the desired language (e.g., ?lang=hi for Hindi).
I used Django REST Framework for this task.

8. Unit Testing
After implementing the backend, I focused on testing to ensure everything works correctly.

I used pytest to write unit tests for the following:
FAQ Model: Testing the creation of FAQ objects, validations, and string representations.
Translation Mechanism: Testing the automatic translation feature using the Google Translate API.
API: Ensuring the endpoints return the correct data, and translations are correctly handled based on the lang query parameter.
Here's an example of the test for FAQ creation:

def test_faq_creation():
    faq = FAQ.objects.create(
        question="What is Django?",
        answer="A web framework.",
        language="en"
    )
    assert faq.question == "What is Django?"
    assert faq.language == "en"
I ran the tests using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
All tests passed successfully, confirming that the implementation was correct.

Project Structure
faqs/models.py: Contains the FAQ model, translations, and related methods.
faqs/views.py: Handles API views for CRUD operations.
faqs/urls.py: Defines the URLs for the API.
faqs/tests/: Contains all unit tests for the project.
faqs/templates/: Stores templates for frontend forms (if any).
settings.py: Configurations for Django and Redis caching.
Installation & Setup
To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
2. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up Redis (Optional but recommended for caching):
Install Redis and run it locally:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get install redis-server
redis-server
4. Run migrations:
bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
5. Start the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver

API Usage
1. Create FAQ
POST /api/faqs/

{
  "question": "What is Django?",
  "answer": "A web framework.",
  "language": "en"
}
2. Get FAQ by Language
GET /api/faqs/?lang=hi

Testing
To run the tests:
pytest

Git & Version Control
All commits follow conventional commit messages:

feat: For new features (e.g., multilingual FAQ model).
fix: For bug fixes (e.g., improved translation caching) and Perform Testing.
docs: For documentation updates.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to design a scalable FAQ management system with multilingual support, a rich-text editor, caching, and an efficient API. It is built with Django, using the Django REST framework, and integrates several useful libraries like django-ckeditor, Redis, and googletrans.
